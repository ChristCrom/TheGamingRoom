The Gaming room was a client that had an application that needed to be ported onto multiple OS devices while still working and intergrating withen each other. We needed users from all Opertaing platforms to be able to communicate with users on other platfroms. I paticularly liked the storage soluction for this documentation. The design contraints and the UML diagram makes it so easy to develope the code for this application. It steps through everything as if it were code itself so when going to actually write up the code it makes it as simple as possible. I would revise the security part of this document. I feel like I did not go into depth as I needed to, to descripe properly what is needed. The user is everything when using an appliction. They are the ones that are going to be using it so they should be considered every step of the way. I enjoyed using this SSD and UML to develope softwarte. I think I would definitly use the SSD docuemnt for certain applications in the furture, espcially if having to develop for a client that is not technical and needs a break down of things.
